index.html: The Structure of Your Website
Your index.html file is the main entry point for your website, defining its structure and linking all the necessary resources. You begin with a proper HTML5 doctype declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>) and set the language to English (<html lang="en">), which is great for accessibility as it helps screen readers understand the page’s language. In the <head> section, you include meta tags for character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8">) to ensure special characters display correctly, and the viewport meta tag (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">) to make the site responsive on mobile devices by allowing it to scale properly. The <title> tag sets the page title to "Craft Cannabis," which appears in the browser tab.

You link your CSS stylesheet (<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">) to apply styles to the page, and you include three external JavaScript libraries: Vue.js (vue@2.6.14) for building a reactive frontend, Axios for making API requests, and GSAP (gsap/3.11.4) for animations. These scripts are loaded from CDNs, which is fine for development but might need to be bundled locally for production to avoid dependency on external servers. At the bottom of the <body>, you include your custom JavaScript file (<script type="module" src="js/main.js">) with the type="module" attribute, which allows you to use modern ES6 module syntax in your JavaScript.

Inside the <body>, you have a root <div id="app"> that serves as the mounting point for your Vue.js application, meaning Vue will control everything inside this div. The navigation bar is defined with a <nav class="main-nav"> element containing a container div (<div class="nav-container">) that holds two parts: a logo section (<div class="nav-logo">) with a "Shop" link (<a href="#">Shop</a>), and a actions section (<div class="nav-actions">) with two buttons—one for "Contact" (<button class="btn btn-primary">Contact</button>) and one for "Shop" (<button class="btn btn-outline">Shop</button>). This matches the design requirement for a navigation bar with a "Shop" link on the left and "Contact" and "Shop" buttons on the right.

The hero section is defined with a <section class="hero"> element that contains two child divs: one for the text (<div class="hero-text">) and one for the image (<div class="hero-image">). Inside the text div, you have a heading (<h1>WHERE CANNABIS MEETS CRAFT</h1>) and a paragraph (<p>Premium organic, small-batch, meticulously handcrafted for perfection, designed to elevate your cannabis experience.</p>), which aligns with the design’s left half. The image div is currently empty but has a class (hero-image) that you’ll style later to display the hero image as a background, matching the right half of the design.
